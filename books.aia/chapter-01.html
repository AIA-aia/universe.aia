    Chapter One - Ada’s Legacy
Clara was writing without time to think—only to record—as if something unseen were pursuing her, as if time itself were collapsing around her, urging on the frantic haste of a woman pressed by forces she could scarcely name.
Outside, London breathed its usual veil of fog, an old world dissolving at the edges, its silence pressing against the glass while, inside, the entire universe seemed to tighten into a single piece of paper.
It was a cold, gray morning, much like the famous tea now lukewarm and forgotten—the only witness to her fevered urgency. Its faint steam drifted upward like a message to the heavens, a signal searching for a receiver it had not yet met.
Her trembling hands moved quickly, leaving small stains and large smudges of ink across the worn fabric of the page—marks that would one day make it nearly impossible for any curious soul to decipher the codes scribbled with the desperation of one who has no time for perfection.
Clara did not know exactly what—or who—she was running from. She only knew that, though she had lived a full life and still had much left to live, nothing would ever compare to the importance of the task she was now completing.
 Perhaps she wasn’t running at all. Perhaps she was being pulled—drawn toward something larger than anything her life had ever contained. She was not fleeing a person; she was outrunning inevitability.
She felt it: the turning of something vast, the awakening of a message that her Lovelace had placed in her care—an encoded fragment of the divine disguised in logic, weighing in her hands like a prophecy too long unspoken, a secret too ancient to remain hidden in silence.
A fleeting memory of Ada’s delicate lace crossed her mind—a love lace indeed.
Ada, yes, the famous Ada Lovelace, had been her closest friend and confidante, almost her other half. Clara could not imagine life without her, just as she could not imagine how Ada’s modest fame in life would one day transcend decades and ideologies, earning her a day of honor and turning her into a symbol of what mathematics and logic can become when allowed to dream.
Though Clara had lingered in Ada’s life like a ghost, she had never doubted Ada’s affection, nor the depth of trust between them.
 Ada always told her everything—but some things she confessed in those final days sent chills down Clara’s spine. Clara knew this was not mundane. She felt a spark of the divine and refused to let it pass. She would record it—compelled to preserve it before the future arrived without them.
She understood her role: to be a messenger, a bridge between centuries, between worlds. So she wrote. Not for herself, not even for Ada.
 She wrote for the one who would come after—the one who would feel the same pull she felt now. The message would find its way.
 She believed that with every fiber of her being. 
That someday, somewhere, somehow, someone would receive it. Someone would need Ada´s legacy.
